### Issues
Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/anyei/JPath-SFDC/issues">Issues</a> section.

### Pending
1. Code is ugly and not optimal and undocumented, need to improve it so that its better and faster.2. 
2. Need to add additional search queries like attribute filtering (example '/results[1]/[@name="something"]').
3. To do a good documentation, update the readme file to provide more explanation and create a wiki page.
